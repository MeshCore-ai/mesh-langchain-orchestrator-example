# Mesh Orchestrator

This project demonstrates how to use the AI Mesh SDK with LangChain to dynamically compose agents into intelligent workflows.

## ðŸ”§ Setup

```bash
# Install poetry if you don't have it
pip install poetry

# Clone this repo or create the structure
cd mesh-orchestrator
poetry install
```

## ðŸ§  Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
MESH_TOKEN=your-mesh-token
```

## ðŸš€ Run the Orchestrator

```bash
poetry run python main.py
```

## ðŸ“‚ What It Does

- Loads all registered agents from Mesh using MeshSDK
- Wraps them as LangChain tools
- Lets an LLM decide which agents to call and when
- Logs all tool calls to `logs/tool_calls.log`

## ðŸ’¡ Example Prompt

> "Find an article about AI regulation in the EU and summarize it."
